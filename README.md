# SCRA2BLE

The RA2 SCRA2BLE integration code is designed to perform the necessary steps to produce the results, diagnostics,and statistical 
interpretations by combining the latest version of the background estimates intoa a figure or into a likelihood model. 

The current version of the code is based on the legacy 13 TeV [RA2 analysis][https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04722], which 
featured 174 search bins with seperate background inputs for each Run era based on the data taking periods in 2016, 2017, 2018 
(further split by HEM affected runs).
